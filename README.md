## Stack
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and using [GraphCMS](https://graphcms.com/) as it underlying headless CMS.

## Running the website locally

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Documentation pages
This website has its own custom documentation page where you can find information about the FAF brand but also about the UI components of this project. It is located in `pages/brand` and the UI section can be seen at http://localhost:3000/en/brand/ui.
